This tests all the algorithms for two constant time properties using Valgrind:

  (1) We do not branch on secrets.
  (2) We do not make memory accesses dependent on secrets.

This does not test whether secrets are passed into variable time instructions.

You need to add your include path to Valgrind's memcheck.h in the `test_case.c` file.

There is only one code path, so Valgrind will cover all the code.

You should run ./unit_tests.sh 13 for the classic mceliece parameter set.
